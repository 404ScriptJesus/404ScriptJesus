# Hello, I'm Tauseef
<a href="https://linkedin.com"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

I am a graduate in computer science with a strong foundation in IT and a deep passion for cybersecurity. After gaining valuable experience as an Assistant System Engineer in an IT consultancy, I transitioned to the banking industry, where I continue to thrive professionally. A banker, father, and dedicated hacker, I spend my free time expanding my expertise in cybersecurity. Through hands-on practice on platforms like Hack The Box, PentesterLab, building home labs, and exploring various tools and techniques, I am constantly sharpening my skills. As an enthusiastic learner, I am determined to transition into the cybersecurity field and pursue it as a lifelong career.
